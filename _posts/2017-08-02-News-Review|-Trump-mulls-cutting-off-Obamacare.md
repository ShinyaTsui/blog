> To summerize:  The relationship between President Trump and Senate Republicans has **deteriorated so sharply** in recent days, as the GOP **labors** to reorient its stalled legislative agenda, a plan to keep up payments to insurers that help low-income consumers afford Healthcare. 
>
> GOP 也就是 trump 所在的党， 极力阻扰民主党senators 在议会想要通过的议案，即增加对保险公司的资助以确保贫困者有足够的补助份额来支付医疗费用。（可支付的医疗法案 本来就是奥巴马所在的民主党提出的） 因为这件事， 两党关系急剧恶化。 

Several Republican senators have sought to distance themselves from the president, who has belittled them as looking like “fools” and tried to strong-arm their agenda and browbeat them into changing a venerated rule to make it easier to ram through legislation along party lines.

这段语言非常的形象， 像browbeat, strong-arm, make it ram through, belittle them as lokking like fools...

### The LA Times| [As Trump mulls cutting off Obamacare aid, Senate begins bipartisan approach](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-senate-bipartisanship-20170801-story.html)

Even as [President Trump](http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/donald-trump-PEBSL000163-topic.html) renews his threat to undermine the [Affordable Care Act](http://www.latimes.com/topic/health/healthcare/healthcare-policies-laws/affordable-care-act-EVGAP00039-topic.html), senior Republican and Democratic senators announced plans Tuesday to begin work on a new bipartisan effort to stabilize the 2010 healthcare law, often called Obamacare.

> 浮世绘： 感受一下，两篇报纸的文风是不是特别不一样。 从 LA 的标题就可以看出来 Trump '**mull**'(think about slowerly and carefully).  Then, first paragraph, "**renew** his threat" "begin work on a new **bipartisan** effort"...
>
> 早上看fox的新闻还听到主持人大骂民主党怎么会让川普这种人当上总统，简直脑子进水...像fox和华盛顿邮报应该都是有自己政治倾向的。
>
> 其实，我很欣赏LA的这篇报道， 立场中立，客观陈述问题， 尤其是后面提到造成法案难推行的原因及后面的解决方案，真的很棒！

> 上一秒华盛顿邮报的报道让你觉得双方好像掐脖子揪头发吐口水一般仇恨，这一秒另一篇让你觉得好像快要握手言和，新闻语言的导向性有时真让我震撼。

#### Three reasons why Healthcare act is stalled

##### 1 Healthcare cover not enough people

The marketplaces, though a pillar of Obamacare, represent a small part of the U.S. healthcare system with just about 10 million people getting coverage there.

##### 2 Insurers exit market because they might be hit with very costly patients

But rate hikes and the decision by many insurers to exit markets amid the current political uncertainty in Washington has threatened consumers’ access to health plans.

##### 3 The aim is make funding assistance through Obamacare to be accessed by low-income consumers, but this payment is stalled by Congress due to certain ruling. 

One critical step is funding assistance through Obamacare to low-income consumers to help offset their co-pays and deductibles. This aid — known as cost-sharing reduction, or CSR, payments — was included in the original law. But the payments have become a political football as Republicans during the Obama administration successfully argued in federal court that the aid can’t be provided without an appropriation by Congress. That ruling has **been on hold** for months.

#### Solutions

1 Congress could simply put an end to that uncertainty by voting to appropriate the CSR money, an idea supported by many lawmakers.

2 Most insurance experts and officials also say **the federal government must create a better system to protect insurers from big losses** if they are hit with very costly patients.
