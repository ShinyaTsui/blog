**What is marriage? **

It depends on what type ofmarriage are we talking about. There are the legal marriage where parties enterinto a legal relationship that is protected by the law. Legal marriage is oftenseen as a basic unit for the social fabric the state seeks to create. There arealso the social concept of marriage, where a monogamic couple (usuallyheterosexual) live together, often with the intent to raise children. It couldalso be both- that the legal framework stems from a social perception, and thesocial perception is reinforced by and largely dependent on the legalframework.

 

**Why marry? **

Marriage brings about bothlegal and social responsibilities. Legally, it gives the partners some degreeof protection. For example, the economically less capable partner oftenreceives alimony when a legal marriage dissolves. In other instances, the lawdictates how assets that the parties accumulate over the period of theirrelationship are shared, based on the degree of contribution from each party.On a social level, there is an implicit rule that marriage should staymonogamous. The party that is involved in extramarital（婚外的） affairs would often bemorally condemn for the act. This provides a degree of protection and anelement of certainty in such relationships.

 

However, these“protections” are not perfect. **Legally,** the institution of marriage mayin some instances limit the vulnerable partner from exercising their rights.Domestic abuse, for example, is grossly under-reported and under-prosecuted asopposed to violent crimes committed by and against strangers because manysocieties still do not view it as a crime, or prefer to prioritize the“sanctity” of a marriage over the people in it.

 

**Socially**, there are considerable amount of social pressure from theimmediate family and the society at large, for young adults to enter intomarriage and reproduce. Furthermore, in vast majority of cases, marriage isarguably bundled with traditional family roles due to the ingrained perceptionattached to it: The husband is the primary breadwinner and the wife is theprimary caretaker of domestic work and child rearing. This perception extendsto the reinforcement of rigid gender stereotypes, compromising the economic andcareer prospects of certain individuals (especially women) and results in someoptions being limited and the continuing underrepresentation of women in theprofessional sphere.  

 

To place the blame solelyon the institution of marriage would be wholly unfounded. Marriage is a fluidconcept that can be moulded by social movements and change of narratives. It istherefore, not the problem but a result of other problems like how the societyinterprets and understands what marriage should be. To simply argue for theabolishment of the marriage would definitely be a mismatch of problem tosolution. 

 

**Who are the parties in a marriage? **

In most societies,homosexual couples are forbidden from conducting legal marriage. The typicalargument against such arrangement is that the definition of marriage, as abasic unit for **child rearing, **does not extend to homosexual couples.Often times, such rhetorics also demonises homosexual marriages as anabomination and results in many being deprived of legal benefits currentlyascribed exclusively to heterosexual couples.

 

There have beensuggestions that the legal concept of marriage be expanded to recognisehomosexual marriages. This expansion is possible because of the simple logic:“all men enjoy equal rights. Marriage is a right. Hence, homosexual should beallowed to marry”. It is often argued that with the legalisation of homosexualmarriages, the discrimination against homosexual community will fade away asthe society “normalise” this type of relationship. An example would be in manyScandinavian countries that legalised same-sex marriage decades ago, it is nowsocially acceptable to be a homosexual individual. This goes to show that withmarriage as an institution, not only does it not hamper social progress, iteven promotes it legislations are changed. 

 

**Do people have free choice when marrying? **



**Proponents**（支持者） of marriage would argue that marriageresults from free choice by both parties, that you cannot drag a stranger toregister as your husband or wife if he/she is unwilling to. However, this isnot definitely not absolute. Aside from the traditional arrangement  orforced marriage that some societies still practices, another more prevalent andendemic factor that affects people’s decision when considering to marry issocial pressure. 

 

Family and society act asthe primary force in pushing unprepared or unwilling partners into a marriage. Suchexpectations are generally harsher on women than men, because of the historicaland misogynistic view that women are reproductive machines with a ticking clockand the objectification of women in their depreciating beauty with time.

 

For non-conformingindividuals, either unable to or unwilling to enter a marriage, it is possiblethat they be coerced into a loveless marriage, completely unprepared for theirduties because of the family and social pressure for one to be “part of thenorm”. This is certainly not a free choice, and could result in disastrousresults to the individuals, their respective families, and the futurechild. 

 

**What are the effects on children?  **



As part of its duty toprotect, States have a responsibility in the upbringing of its futurecitizens,. When we submit ourselves as part of the state and are prepared toobey its rules when necessary, the State has a duty to cater to our basicneeds. This includes our entitlement to a healthy upbringing, having adequatematerial goods and being cared for.

 

While it is impossible forthe State to ensure that each and every person is cared for, most States woulddelegate such duties to the basic unit of family with parents (married adults)being the primary care giver. Families are expected to bear the burden of childrearing, to the best of its capabilities. Most States will not interfere aslong as there are no extremely grave abuses that have been reported to thepolice or other organs of the State.  This also means that there are somechildren still left in the care of questionable parents,  even if they areunemployed, substance abusers etc.

 

It has been suggested thatchildren can be better cared for in the absence of marriage. This mightpossibly be done through raising children communally. This forces the State tobe directly responsible for the child, leading to fewer cases of negligence andabuse, and possibly, a better future for the next generation.

 

The counterargument tothis, however, is that humans are relational creatures. In the vast majority ofcases, children are indeed most valued by, and hence best taken care of, bytheir parents. This, however, is an argument to communal raising of childrenalone, and needs to be linked to why marriage is the optimal institution for itto take place in.
