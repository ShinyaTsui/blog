在所有報導川普反擊的文章中，只有路透社的報導還是以經濟視角出發，很有意思， 別處心裁，分享給大家。

In reality things could be different. **<u>First, sanctions on Iran may not deter its largest markets in China, India, South Korea and Japan from importing Iranian crude anyway - particularly if they are uneasy about unilateral U.S. military moves</u>**. ***<u>Secondly, shortfalls could also be made up by Saudi Arabia, whose spare capacity alone is half Iran's total output. Saudi wants higher prices, but it also targets stable markets.</u>***

Of course, Iran could cause problems in the Gulf by cutting off the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which one-third of all seaborne oil passes. Then, the risk premium in oil really would increase. But the narrow waterway is heavily defended; a so-called tanker war hasn't been seen since Iran and Iraq traded blows in the 1980s. Tensions in the Middle East are rising, but that doesn't mean the oil price has to.

> 浮世绘： 哈！美国动了一下叙利亚，油价马上飙升！作者的观点：Tensions in the Middle East are rising, but that doesn't mean the oil price has to.  为什么呢？ 先说这次油价上涨是害怕伊朗油产出回缩。 伊朗是叙利亚政府同盟，（伊朗是中东目前唯一一个已经确立的“伊斯兰国”，96%什叶派， 与叙利亚现在逊尼教徒为主的反动派互相对立。 什么是伊斯兰国，就是推翻世俗政府比如assad, 建立政教合一的国家，古兰经就是宪法，最高领导人就是历任“哈里发”）

> 看似，伊朗支持assad, 美国就要对伊朗进行制裁，从而影响产出，价格飙升。 但是实际上，伊朗对中国、印度、韩国的出口并不会受太大影响； 其二，即使伊朗产出减少，沙特阿拉伯还会弥补这个空缺。
